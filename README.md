The words we use are fundamentally variable; for example, Spaniards can call a potato patata or papa. But what determines that a Spaniard uses patata sometimes and papa other times? We know we vary the words we use based on the linguistic history we share with an individual partner, such as we are more likely to name an object as papa if our partner previously named the same object as papa (lexical entrainment; Brennan & Clark, 1996). But do we vary the words we use at a community level, based on our beliefs about and experience with a speech community’s preferences? Spaniards do not only know that a potato can be named patata or papa, but they are also aware that patata is the favoured name for potato in Spain; however, they might not know the communal preferences of other speech communities (e.g., the favoured name for potato in Latin America). Then, do Spaniards use the same words with Spaniards (i.e., insiders) versus Latin Americans (i.e., outsiders)? Across a series of experiments, we first examined how speakers’ referential choices with a partner varied based on both their partner’s referential expressions and speech community, and we then examined how speakers’ generalisation of their referential choices to a subsequent partner was modulated by the first and the second partners’ communities. Participants answered two sessions of an online matching-and-naming task, using the same pictures across sessions; and they believed to interact with either an insider or an outsider in each session. We found that participants’ referential expressions with a first partner were affected by that partner’s referential expressions but not by that partner’s community; however, they generalised their referential expressions across two partners based on their speech communities, suggesting that we do not only encode speech community information during dialogue, but this information also affects our language use in future lingusitic interactions. Importantly, our results clearly suggest that we extrapolate community-level knowledge from individual linguistic encounters.
